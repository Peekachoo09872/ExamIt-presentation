## Development & Retrospective

### What Went Well

- Communication was consistent throughout development.
- Version control and task management through GitLab worked well.

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Merge conflicts were a recurring issue in early stages.
- Environment setup took longer than anticipated.
- Test coverage was limited due to time constraints.

### Reflections from Retrospectives
- Sprint reviews helped us continuously refine our work.
- Regular stand-ups kept everyone aligned.
- Better task estimation is a priority for future projects.
